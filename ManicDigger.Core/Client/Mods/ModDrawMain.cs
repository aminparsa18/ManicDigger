/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Positioning this as a mod — rather than calling <c>MainThreadOnRenderFrame</c>
/// directly from the scheduler — keeps render dispatch consistent with the rest
/// of the mod lifecycle and allows other mods registered before it to run their
/// own <c>OnReadOnlyMainThread</c> hooks first.
